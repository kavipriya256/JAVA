/* Create an interface Dept containing two abstract methods getSchoolName() and getSchoolHead() for 
printing the attributes dept_name and dept_head. Also keep a default method getCollegeName() to print 
the college name as “Deemed University”.  
Create a class hostel by implementing Dept interface and containing two protected string instance 
variables hostelName, hostelLocation and a default integer instance variable numberOfRooms. The 
hostel class contains three methods getHostelName(), getHostelLocation() and getNoOfRooms() for 
printing the  instance variables. Also, implement the abstract methods of the Dept interface and override 
the default method getCollegeName() to print the college name as “SASTRA”. 
Raise “InvalidDataException” if the numberOfRooms is negative. 
Then write a Students class by extending the Hostel class and implement the Dept interface. This class 
contains string instance variables studentName, regNo, electiveSubject and a double instance variable 
avgMarks. Write addStudent() method to get the input for all variables. Also, override methods of the 
Dept interface. Write another method Sliding (), to get the details of students along with the department 
details to which the student has slided and Write suitable printData() method to print the details for this 
class (use super keyword in the suitable place to print the details of college from both hostel class and 
from the default method specified in the interface) 
Create an TreeSet to store the details of the students and implements comparable interface to sort the 
students’ objects based on regno. 
Create a GUI to admit new students, migrate a student. Additionally, add moving banner from left to right 
to display welcome message using threading */
